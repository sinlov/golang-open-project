# 脚本化工具

## 像shell一样使用go github.com/bitfield/script

[https://github.com/bitfield/script](https://github.com/bitfield/script)

```bash
$ go list -m -mod=readonly -versions github.com/bitfield/script | awk '{print $NF}'
# v0.14.0
$ go mod edit -require='github.com/bitfield/script@v0.14.0'
```

- Everything is a pipe

use is a pipe

```go
var q script.Pipe
q = p.Match("Error")
// or can load file
var q script.Pipe
q = script.File("test.txt").Match("Error")

// get result
result, err := q.String()
if err != nil {
    log.Fatalf("oh no: %v", err)
}
fmt.Println(result)

// Handling errors
numLines, err := script.File("doesnt_exist.txt").CountLines()
fmt.Println(numLines)
// Output: 0
if err != nil {
	    log.Fatal(err)
}
// Output: open doesnt_exist.txt: no such file or directory
```

Closing pipes

The data source associated with a pipe will be automatically closed once it is read completely. Therefore, calling any sink method which reads the pipe to completion (such as String()) will close its data source. The only case in which you need to call Close() on a pipe is when you don't read from it, or you don't read it to completion.

If the pipe was created from something that doesn't need to be closed, such as a string, then calling Close() simply does nothing.

This is implemented using a type called ReadAutoCloser, which takes an io.Reader and wraps it so that:

1. it is always safe to close (if it's not a closable resource, it will be wrapped in an ioutil.NopCloser to make it one), and
2. it is closed automatically once read to completion (specifically, once the Read() call on it returns io.EOF).

It is your responsibility to close a pipe if you do not read it to completion.
